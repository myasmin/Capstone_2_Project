## CONTEXT:

Customer churn is the percentage of customers that stopped using the company's product or service during a certain time frame.  It costs more to acquire new customers than it does to retain existing customers. This Business Metric helps to understand the reason behind the churn and to take effective initiatives to deal with the churn percentage.

## CRITERIA FOR SUCCESS:

Our goal is to find out what factors may contribute to the Churn of the customers and provide supporting analysis to build an action plan to reduce the Churn.

## SCOPE OF SOLUTION SPACE:

* After the subscription for the service, at which time point the Customers tend to leave most?
* Do the services provided by the company like-Monthly Bills, Internet Speed, Competitorâ€™s Offers contribute to Churn?
* Do Customers' Demography Contribute to churn? (e.g. Location, Family Size, etc)

## CONSTRAINTS WITHIN SOLUTION SPACE:

More than 25% missing entries in the Churn Status and Churn Reason record.
